To automate work tasks:


# Word_Replace_Headers_Footers
This VBA Script strips and replaces all word files in the prompted folder with the headers and footers in the opened word doc source file.
This script is extremely useful for replacing a batch of Word docs with desired headers and footers without having to manually reformat each Word doc.

When using this Script, open the Microsoft Word VBA Editor, copy and paste the code into the Normal->This.Document Microsoft Word Object. Then open the word with the desired header and footer formatting. Make sure that only this desired word doc is opened. This doc will be used as the source file for the header and footer formatting. Then run the script from the VBA editor, it will prompt you to select the folder with the docs that will be reformatted.


# Insert_Macro_Code
This VBA Script inserts the desired Macro Code found in the designated file path into all files in the prompted folder. The Script also converts all Word docs in the folder to macro-enabled-documents to allow the newly inserted macro to function.
